i need a master page for my django app, there have a top bar containing a logo and a navigation bar, and a footer at the bottom of the page. The content of the page should be dynamic, meaning that it can change based on the view being rendered.
nav bar should have links to home, new, popular, and a search bar from left to right. The logo should be on the left side of the top bar. The navigation bar should be responsive and collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. and the most left side of the nav bar have a sign in button that redirects to the sign page. and then aling signin bar with a three dots icon on the right side of the nav bar. The three dots icon should open a dropdown menu with options for about and contact.
The footer should contain copyright information. Use Bootstrap for styling.
